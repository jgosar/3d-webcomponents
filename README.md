A little block building game made with a combination of 3D CSS transformations and Webcomponents.
Each item in the game is a Webcomponent:
- The 3D scene
- The floor
- The blocks
- The color picker 

Controls:
- Place new blocks using left-click
- Remove them using right-click
- Move around:
  - Forward: W
  - Backwards: S
  - Left: A
  - Right: D
  - Up: Q
  - Down: Y/Z (Both are supported because of different keyboard layouts)
- Rotate the camra with arrow keys

You can pick the color of newly placed blocks using the circular color picker in the lower bottom.
Everything you build is stored in your browser and is restored the next time you visit the page.
